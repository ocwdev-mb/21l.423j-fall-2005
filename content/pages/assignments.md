In addition to four 2-3 page response papers to live performances (one of which has to be a purely instrumental performance), students will be expected to trace variations in a single ballad and write a 5-7 page paper about its literary qualities. This paper will be returned graded, and then resubmitted in revised form. They will also be asked to write a 5-7 page paper on a particular artist or genre of fiddle music. Short listening quizzes will help students focus on particular artists, styles, and genres. Each week a different student will choose our "song of the week" from _Our Singing Country_, or _Slave Songs_ _of the United States_, or Child's _Popular Ballads_, volume one. The last week of the semester, students will be expected to perform a fiddle tune, ballad, or song the student has learned, or else present a piece of music that he or she has collected.
